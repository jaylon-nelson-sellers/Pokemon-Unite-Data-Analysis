# Analysis of Characters in the game Pokemon Unite

Pokemon Unite is a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) game based on the Pokemon IP. Players pick characters to battle on a field in a five versus five format. My goal in this analysis is to indentify patterns within character playstyles. I will draw upon methodologies within data science to come to these conclusions. This document will serve to summarize the work.
## Hypothesises
1) By examining character attributes, different classes can be created. These will likely not align fully with in game descriptions.
2) In game there are 5 seperate classes. It is more likely that 6-8 seperate specific classes exist.
3) What character traits are aligned with high tier placements?
