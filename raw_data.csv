For 2s, changes the user s normal movement to dash attacks. After performing a dash attack, the user s next auto attack changes to a unique boosted attack. During this move s effect duration, whenever Zoroark hits enemies with other moves or unique boosted attacks, this move s effect duration is reset to 2s and the user is able to use Night Slash again. This move s effect duration ends if the user moves when they're unable to use Night Slash. During this move s effect duration, if Zoroark hits enemies with a total of six moves and/or unique boosted attacks, the user will jump into the air becoming invincible, and then while landing, slash a set area-of-effect, dealing damage to enemies and additional damage to enemies based on how much HP they are missing. Zoroark additionally recovers HP if enemies are hit with either of the two rectangular diagonally oriented areas of the cross slash up to once per area. Hitting a target in the overlap of the two rectangular diagonally oriented areas will heal double the value. While jumping, the user is able to use Shadow Claw or Cut to move a set distance.

If this move hits an enemy, for 3s, the location where the dash started is marked, and the user is able to use this move again, returning to the marked location, dealing damage to enemies. A new mark is left where that dash started. As long as there is a mark, if the user uses another move, the mark will move to where the move was used. If the user hits enemies four times with either Feint Attack or other moves without interrupting the chain of marking, the next use of Feint Attack changes. If this changed form of Feint Attack is used, Zoroark leaps at the designated enemy. Zoroark designates a direction during the leap to bounce off the target in a designated direction to perform a slashing attack. This slashing attack deals damage to the originally designated target and any Pok mon in the slash area of effect. This slash also deals additional damage based on missing HP and grants unstoppable to Zoroark.
