If an auto attack is used before the leap ends, Zeraora will jump to the closest enemy, dealing additional damage to the target. Holds 3 uses in reserve - after the first use the next use must be executed within 4s or this move goes on cooldown. The second use resets this timer.","Zeraora charges toward an enemy and attacks them with multiple swipes, ending with an interrupt that knocks the enemy into the air for 0.5s.","Zeraora emits an electric aura, damaging all enemies within the aura every 0.3s for 1.5s (6 ticks) followed after 0.4s by a final tick and granting a shield to Zeraora for 3s when it hits. Any paralyzed enemies within the area of effect are pulled towards Zeraora with the final tick, damaging them with an extra tick of damage and stunning them for 1s.","Zeraora charges towards an enemy, damaging them up to three times and switching to the nearest enemy if the initial target's HP drops to zero before all hits are used. Wild Charge applies a hidden effect on targets hit by it for 5s. If this effect is still active, being hit by Wild Charge will result in 50% less damage on the initial hit. Hitting any targets with abilities or boosted attacks applies a buff lasting 5 seconds and stacks up to 3 times. Each stack adds an additional hit to Wild Charge (capped at 6 hits). The first hit deals full damage and subsequent hits deal half damage. Zeraora is untargetable for the duration of this move (1.2s at 0 stacks, 1.5s at 1 stack, 1.8s at 2 stacks and 2s at 3 stacks).","Become unstoppable for 0.5s and launch a bolt of lightning that travels towards the target enemy; dealing damage and knocking up enemies hit along the path for 0.5s and then once again in an area when reaching the target, knocking all enemies hit into the air. Creates an area of electricity for 5s centered on the initial target that paralyzes enemies caught within for 3s. The area also increases Zeraora's auto attack range and auto attack damage by 20% while inside the area.",6319,649,300,118,200,10,20,0,29.99,4250

Zoroark returns to their original form when taking damage, using an auto attack or move, when attempting to score, or when recalling to base. Applying the illusion applies Unstoppable for 20 frames (1/3s). This ability has a 15s cooldown.","Becomes a boosted with every third attack, dealing increased damage.","Dashes in the designated direction, dealing damage to enemies hit.","Dash in the designated direction, dealing damage to enemies, and leaving them unable to act for 0.1s. If this move hits an enemy near the end point of the dash, they will be thrown for 0.3s instead of being left unable to act.","Dashes in the designated direction, dealing damage to enemies, and restoring Zoroark's HP.","Dashes in the designated direction, dealing damage to enemies. If this move hits an enemy, for a short time, this move can be used again.","For 2s, changes the user’s normal movement to dash attacks. After performing a dash attack, the user’s next auto attack changes to a unique boosted attack. During this move’s effect duration, whenever Zoroark hits enemies with other moves or unique boosted attacks, this move’s effect duration is reset to 2s and the user is able to use Night Slash again. This move’s effect duration ends if the user moves when they're unable to use Night Slash. During this move’s effect duration, if Zoroark hits enemies with a total of six moves and/or unique boosted attacks, the user will jump into the air becoming invincible, and then while landing, slash a set area-of-effect, dealing damage to enemies and additional damage to enemies based on how much HP they are missing. Zoroark additionally recovers HP if enemies are hit with either of the two rectangular diagonally oriented areas of the cross slash up to once per area. Hitting a target in the overlap of the two rectangular diagonally oriented areas will heal double the value. While jumping, the user is able to use Shadow Claw or Cut to move a set distance.","Dashes in the designated direction, dealing damage to enemies and resetting all of the user’s move cooldowns. If this move hits an enemy, for 3s, the location where the dash started is marked, and the user is able to use this move again, returning to the marked location, dealing damage to enemies. A new mark is left where that dash started. As long as there is a mark, if the user uses another move, the mark will move to where the move was used. If the user hits enemies four times with either Feint Attack or other moves without interrupting the chain of marking, the next use of Feint Attack changes. If this changed form of Feint Attack is used, Zoroark leaps at the designated enemy. Zoroark designates a direction during the leap to bounce off the target in a designated direction to perform a slashing attack. This slashing attack deals damage to the originally designated target and any Pokémon in the slash area of effect. This slash also deals additional damage based on missing HP and grants unstoppable to Zoroark.","Release dark shockwaves, dealing damage to enemies hit. Three shockwaves are released, and each one has an increasingly larger area-of-effect. Zoroark is unstoppable during this move.",6200,660,260,120,180,10,20,0,30,4250
